	<h1>My programs</h1>
	<p>I have nothing really useful to write in my own webpage so I'll just</br>
	  list the current list of programs that I use in case I forget them and</br>
	  what I use them for.</p>
	<center>
	<p>Inspiration taken from my good friend <a href="https://cravxx.gitlab.io/index.html">cray's website</a>.</p></center>

	<h3>Emacs - Text editing</h3>
	<p>I use Emacs to edit text and a handful of other things.</br>
	  I use it as my main IDE because there is nothing that third party IDEs do that Emacs cannot.</br>
	  It is my favourite software and that's why it's here at the top.</br></p>
	<p>I'm also the main (and only) maintainer of an Emacs distribution called
	  <a href="https://github.com/snackon/Witchmacs" title="Witchmacs on github">Witchmacs.</a></br></p>

	<h3>Xorg - Display server</h3>
	<p>Pretty self-explanatory.</br>
	  Until wayland gets to a state of usability similar to X's, I'll use X.</br></p>
	
	<h3>i3 - Window managing</h3>
	<p>I use i3 as my window manager on Linux.</br>
	  It was the first one I used and I very quickly got used to its keybinds.</br>
	  If I were to try another window manager, I'd have a hard time getting used to new keybinds.</br>And yes, I know that changing keybinds is an option but as I see it, going through that hassle to try out a window manager that I might not like is not worth the effort.</br>
	  My opinion on this might change in the future.</br>
	</p>
	<h3>urxvt - Terminal emulation</h3>
	<p>I use urxvt as my terminal emulator. There is no particular reason as to why.</br>
	  It was the first terminal emulator I used and I haven't really had the need to look for something better</br></p>
	
	<h3>Feh - Image viewing</h3>
	<p>I use Feh as my image viewer on Linux. There is no particular reason as to why.</br>
	  It was the first program that I used for this purpose and I haven't really felt the need to look for something better.</br></p>
	<h3>Thunar - File management</h3>
	<p>I use Thunar to manage my files on Linux. The case is the same as Feh's; it was the first one I used.</br>
	  I've had the itch to try other file managers in the past, like ranger or pcmanfm, but I always end up coming back to Thunar.</br></p>

	<h3>Gimp, Inkscape and Krita - Image editing</h3>
	<p>I use these three programs to make and edit images.</br>
	  Gimp (green is my pepper) is a powerful image-manipulation program but sadly it lacks in the image-creating department. Mainly because it was not designed for that.</br>
	  Thus, for image-making I use krita and Inkscape.</br></p>

	<h3>mpv - Video</h3>
	<p>There is a reason why mpv is only available on Linux: because it's good.</br>
	  My config file for mpv is very minimal and if I were to lose it, I wouldn't lose much.</br></p>

	<h3>ncmpcpp + mpd - Music</h3>
	<p>I'm not a fan of gui music players. So ncmpcpp plus mpd is what I use.</br>
	  I use <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/tree/master/.config">Luke Smith's<a> configuration for it.</br></p>

	<h3>Zathura - Document viewing</h3>
	<p>If I wasn't so dumb like to configure Emacs' docview correctly, I'd use Emacs for viewing PDFs and the such.</br>
	  Luckily, Zathura exists so I use that instead.</br></p>
